# Technical Documentation

This website is built based on the following tools:

- **[Hugo](http://gohugo.io)**, a static site generator written in golang. It generates a fully-functional website using markdown-files in the content section and suitable html-templates.
- **[Github pages](https://pages.github.com)**, Github's framework for hosting static sites
- **[Wercker](http://wercker.com)**, a Docker-based continuous integration tool that handles the build and commit workflow.
- **[Prose.io](http://prose.io#about)**, an online-editing tool for Github-repositories that acts like a content management system.

## Login

Use our github account to login to **[Wercker](http://wercker.com)** and **[Prose.io](http://prose.io)**.

## What to find elsewhere

- **Mardown-Syntax** - Hugo uses [Github-flavoured markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/). To see how to embed pictures, look at existing posts, or consult the [documentation of the theme](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect).
- **How to use the CMS?** - There's a separate docfile for this, which can be found [here](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/blob/master/docs/HOW_TO_USE_THE_CMS.md).
- **How to change fundamental page-settings?** - Look at **[config.toml](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/blob/master/config.toml)**, all fundamental settings of the website are specified here. The file is well-documented.

## Repository-structure

All the project-files are stored in the **[oas-website-hugo-repository](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo)**.

```

### Content

The **[content-folder](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/tree/master/content)** contains the markdown files, which will constitute the content of the page. General content such as the **About** and **Calendar** are stored in this folder. The subfolder **[blog](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/tree/master/content/blog)** contains timestamped posts, such as updates, news, announcements and reports on passed events.

### Static

Static files are stored in the **[static-folder](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/tree/master/static)**. These include image uploads, custom-css and custom javascript.

### Themes

The **[themes-folder](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/tree/master/themes)** contains a copy of the code for the **[hugo-future-imperfect-theme](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect)**. In order to prevent problems in the build step, we use a copy rather than a clone of the original repository, as a git-repository inside a git-repository will be treated as a submodule. Submodules are linked-up git-repositories. An additional clone step is thus required to retrieve the code that is needed for building the website.

### Public

This is the folder hugo will build the static site to. In order to host the site under `oxford-austrian-society.github.io`, github needs the static site to be on the master-branch of a repository with just that name. Hence, this folder is setup as a submodule, linking to the the **[oxford-austrian-society.github.io-repo](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oxford-austrian-society.github.io)**. In the build step, the static site is generated and updates are automatically pushed to the repo. Thus, there is no need to interact directly with this repository.

## Workflow

For guidelines on the general useage of hugo, please consult their excellent documentation: http://gohugo.io/overview/usage/ and http://gohugo.io/overview/installing/.

### Generate new post via command line

Once hugo is installed on your local machine, clone the oas-website-hugo-repository, and enter the folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo
cd oas-website-hugo
```

When in this folder, you can use hugo's command-line tool to generate new posts.

```
hugo new blog/my-post-name
```
This will generate a new markdownfile `/content/blog/my-post-name.md`. The markdown-file will contain the following header:

```
+++
author = ""
date = "YYYY-MM-DD"
categories = []
description = ""
linktitle = ""
featured = ""
featuredpath = ""
featuredalt = ""
type = "post"
draft = true
+++
```

The precise contents of the header are specified in the corresponding  [archetypes-file](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/blob/master/themes/imperfect/archetypes/blog.md) (`/themes/imperfect/archetypes/blog.md]`). The presence of these metadata is crucial for the theme to work correctly.

### Running the site locally

To see whether your new post is working correctly, you can use hugo's inbuilt webserver using:

```
hugo server
```

If the `draft`-flag in your post's metadata is set to true, use:

```
hugo server --buildDrafts
```

### Publishing a new post

To publish a new post to the website, commit your changes, and push it to the repository

```
git add --all
git commit -m "my commit message"
git push
```

### What happens in the background, after a new commit to oas-website-hugo?

The oas-website-hugo-repository is connected to **[Wercker](http://wercker.com)**, a Docker-based continuous integration tool that handles the build and commit. It listens to new commits to the repo, and then runs a pipeline, specified by **[wercker.yml](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oas-website-hugo/blob/master/wercker.yml)**:

```yaml
box: golang:1.5.1
build:
  steps:
    - arjen/hugo-build:
        version: "0.15"
        theme: imperfect
        flags: --buildDrafts=true

deploy:
  steps:
    - install-packages:
        packages: git ssh-client
    - lukevivier/gh-pages:
        token: $GIT_TOKEN
        domain: oxford-austrian-society.github.io
        basedir: public
        repo: oxford-austrian-society/oxford-austrian-society.github.io
```

Wercker uses docker-containers (tiny, virtual linux machines) to handle build- and deploy-processes. We use a debian machine with go-lang-preinstalled, and then run a hugo-build script that can be found here: https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/wercker-step-hugo-build.

After building the site, the contents of the static site sit in the `public`-folder. In the next step, they are deployed simpy by commiting the new contents to the master branch of our **[oxford-austrian-society.github.io-repo](https://github.com/oxford-austrian-society/oxford-austrian-society.github.io)**.

Crucially, this step requires access to  our github-repo, which is implemented via an access-tokes stored in the global variable `$GIT_TOKEN`.  The token was generated on github.com (Settings -> Personal access tokens), and is then stored as a target in wercker (wecker app -> settings -> target). For a nice tutorial on how to set this up see https://gohugo.io/tutorials/automated-deployments/. Crucially, if you should need to set up a new token, do not forget to give it access to your repos, as this is not granted by default!
