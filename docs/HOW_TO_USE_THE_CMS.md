# How to use the CMS to generate new posts

## 1.) Login

Go to **[Prose.io](http://prose.io)** and login with our github account.

## 2.) Folders and finding your way around

The first thing you'll see after logging in, is an overview of our projects.

Via the CMS, you can only edit folders that contains editable content, but no structurally important parts.
Thus, the folder `oxford-austrian-society.github.io` is empty; in the folder `oas-website-hugo` is editable.

To edit existing posts, or publish new ones, first click on `oas-website-hugo`.

## 3) Publish a new post

Let's create a new post! First click on **blog**, then press the **NEW FILE**-button at the top of the page.
