The Austrian journalist Ingrid Thurnher, moderator of the ORF polit talks 'Im Zentrum' and 'Runder Tisch', visited us and gave a talk about the challenges of working within public television. She provided us with insights into how her show is arranged and how topics as well as participants are selected. Not to mention the various interesting and amusing stories she shared with us stemming from interviewing people of public interest during her career.
