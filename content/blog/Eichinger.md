The Oxford Austrian Society was very happy to welcome Dr. Martin Eichtinger, Austrian Ambassador to the UK, for a talk on the importance of the Anglo-Austrian bilateral relations, a following discussion and a dinner in Oxford. We were very happy to also have members of the Anglo-Austrian Society attending the event.
