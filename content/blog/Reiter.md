It was a pleasure to have Martin Reiter, a Styrian tech/start-up manager, here in Oxford to give us insights into the hypergrowth stage of emerging startups. Besides talking about the challenges at his current job at Wayfair, a furniture e-commerce, he told us how he was in charge (Head of International Operations) of expanding Airbnb's business across four continents.
