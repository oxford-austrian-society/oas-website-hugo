## Anglo-Austrian Society: Viennese Ball, 13.02.2016

The Anglo-Austrian Society has kindly invited our members to attend the Viennese Ball on February 13, 2016.

"This Viennese Ball (the only genuine Viennese Ball held in England) is held now every two years at the Oxford Town Hall, the same venue that Strauss himself played in. The music is played by a 45 piece full professional orchestra and for those that don't wish to dance it is possible to enjoy a full concert from the gallery. Refreshments are available to all. The music programme and Ball is totally Viennese all night. Dancing lessons are available the same day. The music programme is always interesting, with a mixture of the familiar and lesser known Viennese music, in a similar vein to the Vienna New Year's Day Concert, but it is for dancing, except the introductory piece."
