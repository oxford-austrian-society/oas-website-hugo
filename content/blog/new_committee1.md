Dear Members,

on behalf of the whole committee I would like to welcome you (back) to Oxford
and to a new and exciting term filled with events.

Leading up to this term we have already had the pleasure of hosting two high-
caliber speaker events with Dr. Ewald Nowotny (Governor of the Austrian National
Bank) and Dr. Karl Sevelda (CEO of RBI). We were particularly excited to also
meet some of our new members at these events.

On another note, I would like to thank everyone involved in the Fresher's Fair; in
particular, many thanks to our secretary Kilian!

For those of you, who have joined us recently, I'd like to introduce the committee
for this academic year. Please feel free to contact any one of us with your ideas,
suggestions or concerns.

President
Melanie Gruenwald (St John's College)

Secretary
Kilian Rieder (University College)

Treasurer
Ronja Woloszczuk (St Catherine's College)

Speakers Officer
Michael Adamer (Merton College)

Social Sec
Lukas Hutter (Lincoln College)


Without further ado, here are our events for the coming term!

We very much look forward to meeting you all!

Best Wishes,

Melanie Gr√ºnwald
