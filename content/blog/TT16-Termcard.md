# Talks on May 10
We've got an exciting day of talks ahead on May 10. First, **Hans Jörg Schelling, Minister of Finances**, will visit us in the afternoon. **Brasenose College, Lecture Room XI, Tuesday May 10, 3pm**.

In the evening, **Alfred Gusenbauer, former Chancellor**, and **Hans Peter Haselsteiner, industrialist and former MP**, will join us for a talk followed by dinner. **Christ Church College, Blue Boar Lecture Theatre, Tuesday May 10, 5.30pm**.

*Dinner information:* We will be going to University College for formal hall and thus need to firmly confirm the attendees in advance. The cost will be 13.58 per person, and you will have to pay in advance to secure a spot. That's not including wine - bring your own. We will contact those signed up directly on how to pay. Spaces are limited and will be allocated first come first serve. Dress code is ideally smart and with gowns, but not at all enforced.
