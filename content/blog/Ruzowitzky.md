Last week, we had the pleasure to have Stefan Ruzowitzky here in Oxford. Mr Ruzowitzky is an Austrian film director and screenwriter who won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2008 with his film 'The Counterfeiters' ("Die FÃ¤lscher"). In an interesting talk he gave insights into the film industry, his role as a director, and his perceptions when watching films produced by other directors.
